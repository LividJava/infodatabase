You should absolutely use the scale because decimals are dumb. But its made in good fun</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The Sallery Scale (aka Sal Scale), is a general, 3-point, rating scale based on the idea that anything more than \"Good\", \"Ok\", \"Bad\" is completely superfluious. Created, coined and used by <a href=\"https://twitch.tv/sallery\">Sallery</a> the scale was developed in distaste for the use of decimals in 5-point and 10-point scales, that, despite having more numbers, one would still continue to use decimals rather than discreet numbers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-scale\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#the-scale\"></a>The Scale</h2>\n<p>Given it is a 3-point scale it is intuitive to understand.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-bad\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#1-bad\"></a>1 \"Bad\"</h3>\n<p>The lowest possible grade. On a 5-point scale, a 1 or 2 is considered a 1 on the Sal Scale. On a 10-point scale 1-3 is considered a 1.</p>\n<p>While this is the lowest possible grade, it isn't necessarily a complete negative hatred for any given subject. It could be something that one wouldn't play again, or something that one wouldn't recommend to others.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-okmeh\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#2-okmeh\"></a>2 \"Ok/Meh\"</h3>\n<p>The Middle/Mediocre grade. On a 5-point scale, a 3 is considered a 2. On a 10-point scale 4-7 is considered a 2.</p>\n<p>A middle of the road option, most subjects will land here. Nothing to write home about but not disliked.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-good\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#3-good\"></a>3 \"Good\"</h3>\n<p>The highest possible grade. On a 5-point scale, 4 or 5 is considered a 3. On a 10-point scale, 8-10 is considered a 3.</p>\n<p>While this is the highest possible grade, it does not mean that any given subject is \"Perfect\" or \"Life-changing\". Merely that the subject is notable enough that one would recommend to others or </p>\n<hr>\n<p>The scale has only 3 options, giving any one person the ability to consiscely grade and categorize any given subject. The scale should never have a decimal as it would completely defeat the purpose of the scale.</p>\n<p>All the points on the scale are subject to the interpretation of the grader. Thus what may be considered a \"1\" for one person could be a \"2\" or someone else, much like other scales. However, unlike other scales something that would be between two grades (ie a 1.5) simply does not exist and immediately gets rounded down, with the understanding that on a Binary scale the grader would have given it a negative rating. The 2 on the scale exists for this purpose and should be used in that case.</p>","noteIndex":{"id":"rz6ooe5c8yfobnumbkp5b7o","title":"Java's Database","desc":"","updated":1751092151911,"created":1682130791054,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"info"},"contentHash":"c42c170ad293c55a0d8748b9e1866295","links":[],"anchors":{"welcome-to-javas-info-database":{"type":"header","text":"Welcome to Java's Info Database!","value":"welcome-to-javas-info-database","line":7,"column":0,"depth":1}},"children":["8x3wnpiw1n98nzo4b6rqgfm","11v7y4rd2yew42mm3atk766","vybdzd0m847pavn5b3acc5g","4gd2597fi4hc5ftx3t4w0o4","o3qg0g31qwt9zdc1anfhn9v","zz475xfe9354uf3cvgu5yew"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"# Welcome to Java's Info Database!\nHere is a collection of information Java uses for various things! if you were Linked here, chances are it was for a tutorial of some kind!\n\nIf you've come from the far reaches of the internet, welcome!
