This guide will take you through the process of installing The Racc Pack.

I'm assuming the following:
1. You have r2modman installed. (if you do not have r2modman installed you can follow [[this guide|meta.r2modman]] to do so.)
2. You are using a Windows device.
3. You have R.E.P.O. installed in a path discoverable by Steam.

## Selecting a game
By default r2modman will not have any game selected, or favorited. You can search for R.E.P.O. in the list.

1. Click the search box at the top an search for 'R.E.P.O.'
2. Click R.E.P.O. to highlight it <font color=#3176bc>blue</font>
3. Click Select game.

**It is highly recommended you click the star next to the Game title to bring it to the top of your list**
