Deckboard is an Alternative to the very expensive Elgato Streamdeck. There are two components to it, the Server application, and the Client application. The client application is to be installed on your Smartphone (it is compatible with both iOS and Android systems, as well as compatible with Windows machines). The Server application is to be installed on the machine you'd like to control, It has a variety of plugins available from its community.
