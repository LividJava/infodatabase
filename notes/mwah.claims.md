<video src="assets/videos/landdemo.mp4" controls title="Land Claim Demo"></video>

The video above demonstrates how to claim land. Holding the Claim Tool (golden shovel) Right click a block to begin the claim setup, then run to an opposing corner and right-click again if your claim is successful, you will see 4 corners with Gold Blocks and Glowstone visualizing your claim. (The yellow transparent box you see is part of a mod.)
