The Sallery Scale (aka Sal Scale), is a general, 3-point, rating scale based on the idea that anything more than "Good", "Ok", "Bad" is completely superfluious. Created, coined and used by [Sallery](https://twitch.tv/sallery) the scale was developed in distaste for the use of decimals in 5-point and 10-point scales, that, despite having more numbers, one would still continue to use decimals rather than discreet numbers.

## The Scale
Given it is a 3-point scale it is intuitive to understand.

### 1 "Bad"
The lowest possible grade. On a 5-point scale, a 1 or 2 is considered a 1 on the Sal Scale. On a 10-point scale 1-3 is considered a 1.

While this is the lowest possible grade, it isn't necessarily a complete negative hatred for any given subject. It could be something that one wouldn't play again, or something that one wouldn't recommend to others.

### 2 "Ok/Meh"
The Middle/Mediocre grade. On a 5-point scale, a 3 is considered a 2. On a 10-point scale 4-7 is considered a 2.

A middle of the road option, most subjects will land here. Nothing to write home about but not disliked.

### 3 "Good"
The highest possible grade. On a 5-point scale, 4 or 5 is considered a 3. On a 10-point scale, 8-10 is considered a 3.

While this is the highest possible grade, it does not mean that any given subject is "Perfect" or "Life-changing". Merely that the subject is notable enough that one would recommend to others or

The scale has only 3 options, giving any one person the ability to consiscely grade and categorize any given subject. The scale should never have a decimal as it would completely defeat the purpose of the scale.

All the points on the scale are subject to the interpretation of the grader. Thus what may be considered a "1" for one person could be a "2" or someone else, much like other scales. However, unlike other scales something that would be between two grades (ie a 1.5) simply does not exist and immediately gets rounded down, with the understanding that on a Binary scale the grader would have given it a negative rating. The 2 on the scale exists for this purpose and should be used in that case.
