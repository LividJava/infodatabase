This section is dedicated to Linux Streaming. Listing out useful programs, workflow ideas, and other various tools based around my own experience. If you're looking for general streaming tools/Windows Tools you can see the [[windows]] section for that, it will be sparce and outdated as I have ceased usage of Windows since January 7th, 2024. If you're curious you can see why in [[personal.anecdotes.whylinux]]. I try to provide open-source alternatives where possible.

## Streaming Tools
 - [[linux.deckboard]]
 - [[linux.firebot]]
 - [[linux.wayland]]
