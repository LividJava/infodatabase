You should absolutely use the scale because decimals are dumb. But its made in good fun\n\n---\n\n\nThe Sallery Scale (aka Sal Scale), is a general, 3-point, rating scale based on the idea that anything more than \"Good\", \"Ok\", \"Bad\" is completely superfluious. Created, coined and used by [Sallery](https://twitch.tv/sallery) the scale was developed in distaste for the use of decimals in 5-point and 10-point scales, that, despite having more numbers, one would still continue to use decimals rather than discreet numbers.\n\n## The Scale\nGiven it is a 3-point scale it is intuitive to understand.\n\n### 1 \"Bad\"\nThe lowest possible grade. On a 5-point scale, a 1 or 2 is considered a 1 on the Sal Scale. On a 10-point scale 1-3 is considered a 1.\n\nWhile this is the lowest possible grade, it isn't necessarily a complete negative hatred for any given subject. It could be something that one wouldn't play again, or something that one wouldn't recommend to others.\n\n### 2 \"Ok/Meh\"\nThe Middle/Mediocre grade. On a 5-point scale, a 3 is considered a 2. On a 10-point scale 4-7 is considered a 2.\n\nA middle of the road option, most subjects will land here. Nothing to write home about but not disliked.\n\n### 3 \"Good\"\nThe highest possible grade. On a 5-point scale, 4 or 5 is considered a 3. On a 10-point scale, 8-10 is considered a 3.\n\nWhile this is the highest possible grade, it does not mean that any given subject is \"Perfect\" or \"Life-changing\". Merely that the subject is notable enough that one would recommend to others or \n\n---\nThe scale has only 3 options, giving any one person the ability to consiscely grade and categorize any given subject. The scale should never have a decimal as it would completely defeat the purpose of the scale.\n\nAll the points on the scale are subject to the interpretation of the grader. Thus what may be considered a \"1\" for one person could be a \"2\" or someone else, much like other scales. However, unlike other scales something that would be between two grades (ie a 1.5) simply does not exist and immediately gets rounded down, with the understanding that on a Binary scale the grader would have given it a negative rating. The 2 on the scale exists for this purpose and should be used in that case.","n":0.051}}},{"i":3,"$":{"0":{"v":"Racc Pack","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"This Category is for everything related to \"The Racc Pack\" a R.E.P.O. modpack available via UUID Codes using r2modman.\n\n### Known Issues\nN/A\n\n### Known/Intentional Caveats\nN/A\n\n### Tutorials\n- [[meta.r2modman]]\n- [[raccpack.install]]\n- [[raccpack.update]]","n":0.192}}},{"i":4,"$":{"0":{"v":"Installing the Racc Pack","n":0.5},"1":{"v":"This guide will take you through the process of installing The Racc Pack.\n\nI'm assuming the following:\n1.

You can test to see if it's installed by running `/sparkc` in-game, if it returns command not found, you need to install it.\n\n## Finding Lag\nAfter installing Spark we need to determine a few things. Firstly, how long our lag spikes last, and then we can profile our game to actually find the source of the problem.\n\n### 1. Monitoring Ticks\nFirst up we need to start our Tick monitor. Achieve this by running `/sparkc tickmonitor`\n\n![](./assets/images/2023-04-21-23-29-28.png)\n\n![](./assets/images/2023-04-21-23-30-30.png)\nAfter the Initial analysis completes you may find some issues about GC, you can ignore this for now.

We are looking for a HUGE spike in ticks.\n\n![](./assets/images/2023-04-21-23-33-13.png)\nThis is a pretty Sizeable spike! so much so it kicked me from the server! (hence the dimmed screenshot)\n\nNow we can run our profiler to try and find the actual source of the lag!\n\n### 2. Profiling the Game\nNow that we have some numbers we'll try and only capture the major spikes! First we need to take the lowest large spike, round it down to the nearest 50 and then start profiling it!\n\nIn the case above, our lowest significant spike was 106.76ms, so we'll round it down to 100\n\n![](./assets/images/2023-04-21-23-38-24.png)\n![](./assets/images/2023-04-21-23-38-51.png)\n\nNow our profiler is running, When any spike happens over 100ms it will be captured in our profiler! We want to try and recreate the lag as best we can (while avoiding a crash!).\n\nAfter we re-produce our spike, we can run `/sparkc profiler stop`\n![](./assets/images/2023-04-21-23-42-05.png)\n\nAnd our report will be generated!\n![](./assets/images/2023-04-21-23-42-25.png)\n\nWhile we're at it let's also disable the tickmonitor\n![](./assets/images/2023-04-21-23-43-14.png)\n\nNow we just click the link, and either open in browser to view it or copy to clipboard to throw at Java.\n![](./assets/images/2023-04-21-23-44-11.png)\n\nExamining the Profiler report is out of scope for this guide!
